## How to contribute (for artists, designers, writers or editors üñç)

Make sure to read the [README.md in the main repository](https://github.com/citapress/citapress) first to find out more about the project. üíô

We manage out tasks using Github issues. An ***issue*** is a self contained task. These issues are organized in ***projects***, where each book in progress has a corresponding project. You can see our list of books under the 'Projects' tab or by clicking here.

### I wanna get started and help out!

The following is a step-by-step guide on how to contribute using our issues system on Github:

1. **Create a GitHub account**. You will need one to indicate you will be working on a task and it helps us keep track of your contributions.
2. **Check out our [list of open issues](https://github.com/citapress/books/issues)**.
  - If you're an artist or designer, [you can filter by the `design` tag](https://github.com/citapress/books/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adesign).
  - If you're an editor or writer, [you can filter by the `editing` tag](https://github.com/citapress/books/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%editing).
  - Otherwise, we still have plenty of work that needs to be done. [We organize this under the `general` tag](https://github.com/citapress/books/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ageneral).
3. When you've decided what to work on, **assign the issue to yourself** so that other people know someone is working on that specific issue.
4. Make sure to **add any relevant info and updates as comments** on the issue.
5. When you're finished, you can **submit your work by creating a pull request**. [Here's a short guide on how to do that](#).
