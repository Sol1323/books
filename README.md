## How to contribute (for artists, designers, writers or editors )

Hi! We're very excited you're interested in contributing to Cita. All of our work is done by volunteers and we welcome you with open arms and lots of emoji. 🤓

We manage out tasks using **issues**. An ***issue*** is a self-contained task. These issues are organized in ***projects***, where each book in progress has its corresponding project.

**You can see our list of books under development on the [Projects tab or by clicking here](https://github.com/citapress/books/projects).**

### I wanna get started and help out!

The following is a step-by-step guide on how to contribute using our issues system on Github:

1. **Create a GitHub account**. You will need one to indicate you will be working on a task and it helps us keep track of your contributions.
2. **Check out our [list of open issues](https://github.com/citapress/books/issues)**.
    - If you're an artist or designer, [you can filter by the `design` tag](https://github.com/citapress/books/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adesign) 🖍
    - If you're an editor or writer, [you can filter by the `editing` tag](https://github.com/citapress/books/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aediting) 📚
    - Otherwise, we still have plenty of work that needs to be done. [We organize this under the `general` tag](https://github.com/citapress/books/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ageneral).
3. When you've decided what to work on, **assign the issue to yourself** so that other people know someone is working on that specific issue.
4. Make sure to **add any relevant info and updates as comments** on the issue.
5. When you're finished, you can **submit your work by creating a pull request**. [Here's a short guide on how to do that](#).
